NAME
    Module::Math::Depends - Convenience object for manipulating module
    dependencies

DESCRIPTION
    This is a small convenience module created originally as part of
    Module::Inspector but released seperately, in the hope that people might
    find it useful in other contexts.

METHODS
  new
      my $deps = Module::Math::Depends->new;

    Creates a new, empty, dependency set.

  from_hash
      my $deps = Module::Math::Depends->from_hash( \%modules );

    Creates a new dependency set from a raw hashref of modules names and
    versions.

  add_module
      $deps->add_module( 'My::Module' => '1.23' );

    Adds a single module dependency to the set.

    Returns true, or dies on error.

  merge
      $my_deps->merge( $your_deps );

    The "merge" method takes another dependency set and merges it into the
    current one, taking the highest version where both sets contain a
    module.

    Returns true or dies on error.

  as_string
      print $depends->as_string;

    Converts the dependency set to a simple printable string.

SUPPORT
    This module is stored in an Open Repository at the following address.

    <http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Module-Math-Depends>

    Write access to the repository is made available automatically to any
    published CPAN author, and to most other volunteers on request.

    If you are able to submit your bug report in the form of new (failing)
    unit tests, or can apply your fix directly instead of submitting a
    patch, you are strongly encouraged to do so as the author currently
    maintains over 100 modules and it can take some time to deal with
    non-Critcal bug reports or patches.

    This will guarentee that your issue will be addressed in the next
    release of the module.

    If you cannot provide a direct test or fix, or don't have time to do so,
    then regular bug reports are still accepted and appreciated via the CPAN
    bug tracker.

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Module-Math-Depends>

    For other issues, for commercial enhancement or support, or to have your
    write access enabled for the repository, contact the author at the email
    address above.
